# EnZilium Java Kata

> In this repository you'll find **EnZilium Kata**. This kata is to introduce yourself into the code structures of the dictioneries. If you never have worked before with dictionaries you have found the ideal repository to get started. Check the code and get an idea about how to work with them if you have worked with Java before it will surprise you becuase it's easier than it looks, I promise. If you're brave enough clone this repository and run the program to know how should looks the output, copy the main app class and the GenSig entity and try to develop the rest of the code, don't worry you can have a hint checking my code if you get stuck at some point.

## Motivation

One of the main motivations for this kata is that I've been investing by myself into the crypto coins, I even invest on Ethereum a while ago and I've found it so enjoyable. At the same time till the moment I've just woked with lists with Java and this kata was the first one I've ever made to know how I should work with the dictionaries, how I said before it surpised me becuase I though it was going to be a lot harder than it has been at the end. I hope you're gettin excited to try it, don't worry is quite short and the level it's really basic.

## Reflections

My reflection about this kata is that at the end it turn out that it has surprised me, I was expecting to be a lit more difficult that truly is and this fact made me so happy because I've realized how much I've improved my skills programming with Java. If a have a retrospective from a month ago and remember that I hardly could work with lists and now seeing myself working with dictionaries and feeling comfortable I just have to say that this is one of the best feeling that I get when I program, I feel a bit like if I started to develop my super powers. And my reflection about the EnZilium kata is that even knowing that the thematic has scared a bit at the beginning one time I got into the logic of the program I could see by myself that I got scared for nothing, the code you have to develop is simple, the logic is not too complicated and all this is because this kata has been made specially to get an introduction into this new code structures. I liked everything about EnZilium and I hope you'll like too.
